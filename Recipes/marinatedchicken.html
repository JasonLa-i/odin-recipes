    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my go-to dieting recipe for chicken that is low-calorie and still tasty. You can use chicken breast or chicken thigh. I typically use chicken drumstick as it is 1/3 the price of chicken thigh and tastes the same</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs. boneless skinless chicken thighs or breast</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked pepper </li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt </li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper to a bowl or a large zip top bag. Stir the ingredients in the dish until combined.</li>
        <li>If using breasts, fillet each chicken breast into two thinner pieces. Place the chicken in the bag or in a shallow dish, then pour the marinade over top, making sure the chicken pieces are completely covered in marinade. Marinate the chicken for 30 minutes, or up to 8 hours (refrigerated), turning occasionally to maximize the chicken's contact with the marinade.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, heat a large skillet over medium. Transfer the chicken from the marinade to the hot skillet and cook on each side until well browned and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes each side, depending on the size of the pieces). Cook two pieces at a time to avoid overcrowding the skillet, which can cause juices to pool and prevents browning. Discard the excess marinade.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked chicken from the skillet to a cutting board and let rest for five minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
